Growing up in DC, I loved games and game music with a passion that was hard to explain to those around me. When I discovered MAGFest almost by accident in my backyard, it was like discovering an entirely new world of people I just needed to become friends with. \n\nSince my first MAG in 2007, I've attended in just about every capacity I can think of: as a drunken guest, as a wannabe influencer, as a reporter, as a esport competitor, as a panelist, and even as a mainstage performer. MAGFest has directly altered my career path, ultimately helping me find my way into the games industry, and allowing me to play my music for more people I could have ever dreamed of. \n\nEvery year I attend MAGFest thinking it could never live up to previous years' experiences. And EVERY YEAR, I come away with a new, once-in-a-lifetime memory or experience. (It's true. I have a spreadsheet!) I cannot imagine a world without MAG. Please DONATE!!",
